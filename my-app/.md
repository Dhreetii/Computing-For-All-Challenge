What is the URL to your GitHub-Pages site?
  I did not deploy the page as I was unavailable to get it to successfully render on time. I am not familiar with
  using React to fetch data from APIs, and tried my best by observing demos online and using them to fulfill the
  specifications within a time constraint. I did not figure out how to avoid the initial fetch request with
  undefined search terms here. However, please consider the code I've written, and I'm confident I will grow
  from this experience and be able to debug this webapp in the future.
What API did you use and why?
  I used the iTunes Search API. I personally love music, and was interested in using a music related API
  for users to search terms related to iTunes products such as albums, podcasts and movies. I look up
  similar terms frequently when I hear unfamiliar music that I enjoy.
What are some other applications for your API other than searching? Name a few and describe how an app using it for that purpose might work.
  The iTunes API is primarily for searching. Instead of searching terms, it may be useful to look up
  multiple artists by their IDs, books by their ISBNs, etc. Such apps may be useful for merchants
  to catalogue physical albums/books.
Explain the considerations you needed to make for the website to be responsive & mobile-friendly.
  I did not get to making the website mobile-friendly, but it would require resizing the image on the homepage
  according to screensize, making body elements fit to a mobile size, and ensuring the search term bar
  and dropdown bar take up a respectively smaller but usable size of the mobile page.
How can you make your app accessible to people with disabilities such as blindness or colorblindness?
  The app can be made accessible by adding alt text for the iTunes logo, avoiding only red/green colors, including
  zoom in options, using easily readable font.
If you could make further changes to your project to improve/expand the experience, what would they be and how would you go about implementing them?
  I would add additional filters to search by country and language by including them as query parameters.
